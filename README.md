# Melanoma Detection Assignment
Problem statement: To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
- Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert             dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
- Early detection of skin cancer could save lifes
- Evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma at early stages
- The data set contains the following diseases:
    Actinic keratosis
    Basal cell carcinoma
    Dermatofibroma
    Melanoma
    Nevus
    Pigmented benign keratosis
    Seborrheic keratosis
    Squamous cell carcinoma
    Vascular lesion

## Conclusions
- From the provided data set, concluded that
  As training accuracy increases linearly overtime, where as validation accuracy increases in the process of training.
  Training loss decreases with epochs the validation loss also decreases.
  Above plot shows gap between accuracy for training and validation have decreases significantly compared to previous model and achived around 62% on validation set
  Accuracy difference between training and validation is less
